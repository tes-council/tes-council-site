Goodyear announced the launch of Goodyear Proactive Solutions. This will aim to use new technologies such as predictive analytics to help truck fleet managers better handle how their vehicles are used. Using intelligent computer algorithms, a wealth of data derived from Goodyear’s extensive commercial tyre and service business, and clear, accurate reporting, the solutions allow fleet operators to precisely identify and resolve tyre-related and potential safety issues before they happen.
