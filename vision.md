**The TES Strategy imagines a 2025 environment where:**

* Every UK engineered asset is connected, measuring performance in real time, adapting to work flawlessly, always;
* High value service decision-making is delivered remotely from UK centers of excellence, using integrated design, manufacture and operational data;
* The behaviors of all those involved are fully focused on delivering value in use at minimum financial and environmental cost;
* The UK leads in a competitive world market where the service model has replaced ownership across most high value manufacturing sectors;
* Business models and financial models reward long-term value creation and where the associated skills and capabilities enjoy robust institutional support.

The TES Strategy, launched in July 2016, identified the following key issues to be addressed:

* **Awareness**: TES are not yet part of the vocabulary of our national industrial and sector strategies. Only a minority of industrial leaders have understood and grasped the potential of asset services;
* **Culture**: The majority of manufacturing industry remains product centric in its thinking. Customer needs are quickly translated into product features and life-cycle thinking ends with the warrantee period. Circular economy concepts and through-life thinking is not engrained in our national culture;
* **Understanding**: Only a few have successfully made and understand the product servitisation journey. The cost of change is high with every practitioner forging their own path and developing their own bespoke capabilities. Access to shared learning is poor, leading to costly re-learning or failure;
* **Transition**: The journey from a product centric to a service centric supplier is difficult. Organisations (both suppliers and users, and particularly SMEs) have little support. Collaborative research, bodies of expert knowledge and enabling business and financial frameworks are scarce resources.

# Alignment to the National Industrial Strategy

TES is well positioned as a key building block of the National Industrial Strategy directly contributing to multiple pillars, with significant opportunity to address the underlying industrial challenges.

**Building on our strengths and closing the gap between our best and worst performers**: the UK has been a leading pioneer in TES, originating many of the innovations in the field. Yet we have failed so far to translate this success across the full range of industrial sectors. The opportunity for knowledge sharing and acceleration of competitiveness across sectors is immense.

**Make the UK one of the most competitive places in the world to start or to grow a business**: TES is a rapid growth area and with the advent of new digital connectivity the scale, variety and global export potential of TES providers is huge. There are substantial opportunities for both major full-service providers and smaller niche TES supporting businesses to emerge and thrive if the UK has the correct supporting infrastructure and skills base.

# TES Council objectives

The TES Council formed at end 2016 as an interest group of leading industrial, academic and government practitioners and stakeholders aims to facilitate delivery of the TES Strategy and associated benefits to UK productivity, recognising that this will benefit the global competitiveness of its membership.

The Council believes the time to promote a focus on engineering services and servitization is now: especially in the context of the proposed National Industrial Strategy and the opportunities enabled by emerging digital technologies. The objectives of the TES Council are to promote the cooperative, cross-sector approach advocated in the TES Strategy, particularly engaging SMEs that find it difficult to compete in this area. Specifically, the TES Council will:

* **Build awareness of the critical role of TES in science, research and innovation**, and in the development of skills and industrial capability to effectively support new servitized business models in the digital economy;
* **Encourage development of tools and techniques**, including new curricula and research to accelerate innovation and capability development in TES, and transition to new business models;
* **Share knowledge and experience** from premier manufacturers to the rest of the UK manufacturing supply chain to accelerate capability development and avoid re-inventing the wheel;
* **Advise Government and other customers for TES** (such as owners and operators of large infrastructure or other high-value, long-life assets) on measures to accelerate productivity improvement through TES.
