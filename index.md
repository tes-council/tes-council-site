This intiative makes the case for a national focus on Through-life Engineering Services (TES), supporting the overall UK National Industrial Strategy to make the UK a world-wide leader in TES products, services and solutions with a direct impact on UK productivity. A focus on TES supports both organisation effectiveness and national productivity, linking the development of new engineering, business and commercial skills and capabilities with the needs of new  business models such as servitization and sustainable manufacture within the developing digital economy

The TES Council is an interest group formed in 2016 by leading industrial, academic and government practitioners and stakeholders, which complements the Digital4Manufacturing Leadership Group led by the High Value Manufacturing Catapult.

# Scope of TES

Manufacturers are shifting from transactional (product sales) to solutions-based business models (delivering a range of capabilities) featuring long-term, high-value, incentivised, and often ‘pay as you go’ contracts. This transformation is known as servitization (see the [following page for examples](./examples/) including the well-known Rolls-Royce ‘power-by-the-hour’ solution).

Through-life Engineering Services (TES) capture the new engineering and business capabilities and processes required to design, operate and maintain the complex products and assets that are incorporated into these long-life solutions.

The goal of TES is to increase asset life-time whilst maintaining optimum performance levels ‘**making things work better, for longer at lower cost**’ to the benefit of the end-customer, the producer and the supply chain.

# Case for TES

Industry is critically dependent upon reliable, daily use of engineered assets. Engineering services keep those assets working. Engineering services drive productivity, offering enhanced customer value, increasing competitiveness, creating revenue growth and high value jobs, and strengthening the entire UK supply chain of goods and services.

* Around 16.8% or £275.2bn  of the UK economy by GVA is attributable to sectors directly influenced by the use or support of high value, long-life assets;
* Of this, as much as 11% (£184bn)1 could achieve efficiency improvements exceeding 20% (£37bn)1 driven by TES.
* There is some evidence that the UK has less than 5% of the global market: at present this is declining but development of globally-leading capabilty will open a huge world market

Many premier UK manufacturers are making the transition to service providers. The most advanced earn more than 50% of revenue and a much higher proportion of their profit from service provision, but entry is difficult. Progress towards maturing the necessary technology, relationships and behaviours in new sectors and across existing supply chains is slow and inefficient.

Different sectors are servitizing at different rates often re-inventing the wheel. Smaller companies are finding it particularly difficult to enter the market and support servitized supply chains.

The more cooperative, cross-sector approach advocated by the TES Council, together with Government support will **accelerate achievement of significant productivity improvement over a significant proportion of the economy.**
