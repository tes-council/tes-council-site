# Next steps and support requirements

The Council will focus on leading change, but requires wider support from industry, commerce, academia and the government to accelerate the creation of a differentiating national capability.

Government is a dominant consumer of through-life engineering services and has a critical role in shifting procurement practice from capital acquisition to outcome based service provision. Government also has a key role in encouraging, supporting and incubating through-life engineering technology and capability development.

Despite being relatively new, the TES Council is well represented by leading industrial, academic and government practitioners and stakeholders. It is committed to the development of TES and it has already begun the process of standardising terminology and defining the key building blocks. Over the next 6-months the council intends to:

* Develop a detailed plan on how to launch TES and engage a wider audience of UK manufacturers (June);
* Define the budget requirements and request support funding from UK Government, most likely through the Industrial Strategy Challenge fund (September).

Our immediate support requirements and request to UK government are:

* Accept an invitation from TES Council members to present in more detail the opportunities that investing specifically in TES can bring to the UK manufacturing sector;
* And as a result, acknowledge TES as a critical delivery engine for National Industrial Strategy, to which the UK Government will provide greater visibility and financial support.
